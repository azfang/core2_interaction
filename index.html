        <p>“There are endless possibilities as to what a website could be. What kind of room is a website? Or is a website more like a house? A boat? A cloud?” - Laurel Schwulst</p>
        <p>This course is an extensive investigation in interactive concepts and techniques, particularly as it applies to the web. Building upon preexisting knowledge of basic graphic design, 
            composition, and typography, we will learn how to design and develop complex interactive projects — and examine ever-shifting definitions and properties of the web in relation to each of your own design practices.</p>
        <p>We will learn how to create expressive web-based experiences that challenge existing digital stereotypes and conventions. Conceptual thinking, playful user experiences, interpretation of content,
            and general problem solving will be critical in the upcoming weeks together. By the end of the semester, students should be able to demonstrate a comprehension of skills, techniques and processes to realize interactive systems, 
            particularly systems for dealing with unpredictable, variable, and dynamic content.</p>
        <p>In our studio hours together, we will emphasize design practice. While you are not expected to become a programmer by the end of this course, the lab section will provide you with technical demonstrations that allow you to
            develop and properly realize your ideas. Both classes will focus on design, conceptual, and technical achievement and your approach towards these areas.</p>
        <p>You’ll learn in this course not only by completing the assignments but by contributing to class critiques, listening to lectures, following along with demos, and discussing readings. It is implied that success 
            in this course is predicated on active participation, helping your classmates improve, and contribution to a critical design class culture. We're looking forward to having an amazing semester with you all!</p>
